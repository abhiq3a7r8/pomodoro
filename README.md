# Pomodoro Timer

This is a simple web-based Pomodoro Timer implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique aims to enhance focus, productivity, and mental agility.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The default work interval is 25 minutes, and the default break interval is 5 minutes. You can adjust these durations when prompted.
4. Click the "Start" button to begin the timer.
5. The timer will alternate between work and break intervals as specified, updating the displayed time accordingly.
6. Once the work interval is completed, the timer switches to the break interval and vice versa.
